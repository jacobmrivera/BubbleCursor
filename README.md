# BubbleCursor

To run, please open the html file in a web browser and begin to click the dots!

To toggle between bubble cursor and a normal cursor, you can click the self described button.

No sources aside from documentation and a little chatGPT for javascript and CSS syntax! But I did not feel like those need to be listed as I didn't follow anything extensively or in particular.
